## shinylive

A project for deploying Shiny applications that will run completely in the browser (R and python)

<br>

R and Python are compiled to WebAssembly (aka wasm)

 - R and packages are made into a binary format that can be embedded in the website. 
 - JavaScript is the interface that the browser uses.

I'll talk about adding shiny to Quarto documents (a book, in my case)

([Quarto extension](https://github.com/quarto-ext/shinylive), [R package](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive))

## yml options

Your shiny app goes in a single code chunk of type `shinylive-r` and use the `standalone` option: 

````yml
```{shinylive-r}
#| label: fig-shiny-spline
#| standalone: true
````

<br> 

You also have to add a Quarto _filter_ in your `_quarto.yml` file: 

```yml
filters:
  - shinylive
```

## Package declarations

<br> 

At the start of the shiny code chunk, declare your package dependencies using: 

```{r}
#| label: pkg-installs
#| eval: false

webr::install("ggplot2")
```

There currently is no `webr` package; it's all internal. 

<br>

(GH issue: [Add feature/instructions for additional R packages](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive/issues/9))


# If you live in JavaScript's house, you have to live by JavaScript's rules


## Data access

<br> 

You _don't_ get automatic access to your local data (currently)

<br> 

`download.file()` is an option but it must be done using specific request types. 

<br> 

It's a work in progress.  (GH issue: [Add local folder support](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive/issues/13))

## Thanks

Thanks for the invitation to speak today!

Thanks to George Stagg, Joe Cheng, Winston Chang, and everyone else who made `webR` and `shinylive` happen.
